# hungry-shark
Used Object-Oriented Programming to design an animated game in Processing based on Python as a final project for my Introduction to Computer Science class. 

## Description
The game is a variation of Hungry Shark Evolution. A hungry shark is in search of fish. There are lots of fish in the sea which the shark can eat but there are also jellyfish which can poison the shark and hence, are to be avoided by the shark.

## Features
1. Consists of 2 modes: easy and difficult. 
   * In the easy mode, the shark is supposed to eat 10 fish to win and has three lives in hand. Therefore, if it bumps into a jellyfish thrice, the game ends there.      
   * In the difficult mode, the shark is supposed to eat 20 fish. While the number of lives remains the same, the number of fish and jellyfish appearing are relatively less and more respectively. 
2. Efficiently handles multiple screens using keyboard/mouse interaction.
3. Uses the concept of collision detection to determine whether a collision is taking place between different objects.
4. Plays different sound effects depending on the type of collision (shark/fish or shark/jellyfish).
5. Displays a score bar and health bar to keep track of playerâ€™s progress and the number of lives remaining.
6. Dedicated restart button on the end screen which is displayed once the game is over.
